This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a collection of machine learning interview questions and job search resources focused on top-tier tech companies and hedge funds. The repository serves as a comprehensive resource for ML practitioners preparing for interviews at companies like Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other high-paying tech firms.

## Content Structure

### Core Content
- **README.md**: Contains 189 ML interview questions from top companies (Meta, OpenAI, Google, Citadel, etc.)
- Questions are categorized by company and cover diverse ML topics including:
  - Deep learning fundamentals
  - Neural network architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
  - Statistics and probability
  - MLOps and production systems
  - System design for ML applications
  - Company-specific scenarios (recommendation systems, search, autonomous vehicles)

### Company Rankings
The repository includes subjective rankings of ML companies based on:
- Perception and culture
- Training programs
- Prestige
- Compensation (minimum $300k/yr, with Tier 1-2 requiring $500k+)

Tier structure:
1. **Tier 1**: Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Nvidia
2. **Tier 2**: Citadel, Netflix, Google, TwoSigma
3. **Tier 3**: RunwayML, Uber, xAI
4. **Tier 4**: Microsoft, Tesla, TikTok, Stripe, Cruise
5. **Tier 5**: Lambda, Figure AI, Scale, Coinbase, Reddit, Adobe
