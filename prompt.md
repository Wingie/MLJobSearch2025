# ML Interview Question Research Prompt

## Objective
Research and create a complete educational chapter for the ML interview question: "[QUESTION_TEXT]"

Target audience: Complete beginners with no prior ML knowledge
Output format: mdbook-compatible markdown chapter
Purpose: Interview preparation and foundational learning

## Research Requirements

### 1. Question Analysis
- Analyze what the question is truly testing
- Identify why top companies (Meta, OpenAI, Google, etc.) ask this
- Determine the difficulty level and expected depth of answer

### 2. Comprehensive Research
- Search for authoritative sources (academic papers, documentation, tutorials)
- Find real-world applications and case studies
- Look for common implementation patterns
- Identify typical mistakes and misconceptions
- Research mathematical foundations (if applicable)

### 3. Content Structure
Create a markdown file with this exact structure:

```markdown
