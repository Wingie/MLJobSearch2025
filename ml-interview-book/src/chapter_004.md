# Understanding Mean, Median, and Mode in Skewed Distributions

## The Interview Question
> **Meta, Google, OpenAI**: "What happens to the mean, median, and mode when your data distribution is right skewed versus left skewed? Can you explain the relationship between these measures of central tendency?"

## Why This Question Matters

This question is a cornerstone of statistical literacy that major tech companies use to assess multiple critical skills:

- **Data Quality Assessment**: Understanding how outliers and skewness affect different metrics helps you choose appropriate summary statistics
- **Model Performance**: Skewed distributions can severely impact machine learning model performance, especially linear models
- **Business Decision Making**: Choosing the wrong central tendency measure (like using mean income instead of median) can lead to poor business decisions
- **Data Preprocessing Knowledge**: Demonstrates understanding of when data transformation is necessary before modeling

Companies like Meta and Google deal with highly skewed data daily - from user engagement metrics to revenue distributions - making this knowledge essential for data scientists and ML engineers.

## Fundamental Concepts

### What Are Measures of Central Tendency?

Measures of central tendency are single values that represent the "center" or "typical" value of a dataset. Think of them as different ways to answer "What's a normal value in this data?"

**Mean**: The arithmetic average - add all values and divide by count
**Median**: The middle value when data is sorted - 50% of values are above, 50% below  
**Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset

### Understanding Distribution Shape

**Symmetric Distribution**: Like a perfectly balanced seesaw - the left and right sides mirror each other
**Skewed Distribution**: Like a lopsided seesaw - one tail is longer than the other

**Right Skewed (Positive Skew)**: The right tail stretches out longer, pulling the distribution toward higher values
**Left Skewed (Negative Skew)**: The left tail stretches out longer, pulling the distribution toward lower values

### Why Skewness Matters

Imagine measuring the heights of people in a room. If everyone is roughly the same height, you get a symmetric distribution. But if you measure household incomes in a city, you get right skewness - most people earn moderate amounts, but a few very wealthy individuals create a long right tail.

## Detailed Explanation

### The Fundamental Relationship

In skewed distributions, the mean, median, and mode don't converge to the same point like they do in symmetric distributions. Instead, they spread out in a predictable pattern:

**For Right-Skewed (Positively Skewed) Distributions:**
```
Mode < Median < Mean
```

**For Left-Skewed (Negatively Skewed) Distributions:**
```
Mean < Median < Mode
```

**For Symmetric Distributions:**
```
Mean = Median = Mode
```

### Why This Happens: The Pull of Outliers

Think of the mean as being "pulled" by extreme values. Here's why:

**The Mean is Sensitive**: Every single value in your dataset affects the mean. If you have extreme values (outliers) on one side, they pull the mean toward them like a magnet.

**The Median is Resistant**: The median only cares about the middle position, not the actual values of extreme points. You could have billionaires in your income dataset, but if they're in the top 1%, they won't shift the median much.

**The Mode is Local**: The mode represents where most of your data clusters, unaffected by what happens in the tails.

### Real-World Example: Website Traffic

Imagine you're analyzing daily page views for a company blog:

**Right-Skewed Scenario:**
- Most days: 100-500 page views (normal traffic)
- Occasionally: 10,000+ page views (viral content)
- Mode: ~200 views (most common day)
- Median: ~300 views (middle value)
- Mean: ~800 views (pulled up by viral days)

**Business Impact:** If you use the mean (800) to plan server capacity, you're over-provisioning. If you use it to set revenue expectations, you're being overly optimistic.

### Visual Description of Skewness

**Right-Skewed Distribution:**
Picture a mountain with a steep cliff on the left and a gentle slope on the right. Most of your data clusters near the cliff (low values), but the gentle slope extends far to the right (high values). The mode sits at the peak, the median partway down the slope, and the mean gets pulled further right by that long tail.

**Left-Skewed Distribution:**
Now flip that mountain - gentle slope on the left, steep cliff on the right. The long left tail pulls the mean leftward, while the mode stays at the peak on the right.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Karl Pearson's Empirical Relationship

For moderately skewed distributions, statistician Karl Pearson discovered an approximate relationship:

```
Mode ≈ 3 × Median - 2 × Mean
```

Or rearranged:
```
Mean - Mode ≈ 3 × (Mean - Median)
```

This formula tells us that the distance between mean and mode is roughly three times the distance between mean and median.

### Example Calculation

Let's say you have income data where:
- Mean = $60,000
- Median = $45,000

Using Pearson's formula:
```
Mode ≈ 3 × $45,000 - 2 × $60,000
Mode ≈ $135,000 - $120,000 = $15,000
```

This suggests the most common income is around $15,000, with the mean pulled upward by high earners.

### Measuring Skewness Numerically

Skewness can be quantified using the formula:
```
Skewness = 3 × (Mean - Median) / Standard Deviation
```

- Skewness = 0: Perfectly symmetric
- Skewness > 0: Right-skewed
- Skewness < 0: Left-skewed

## Practical Applications

### 1. E-commerce Revenue Analysis

**Scenario**: An online store analyzing customer order values

**Right-Skewed Reality:**
- Mode: $25 (most common small purchases)
- Median: $40 (half of customers spend less/more)
- Mean: $75 (pulled up by luxury buyers)

**Business Decisions:**
- Use median for typical customer messaging
- Use mean for revenue projections
- Use mode for inventory planning of popular items

### 2. Machine Learning Feature Engineering

**Problem**: Training a price prediction model with right-skewed housing prices

**Without Transformation:**
- Linear models perform poorly due to outliers
- Model gets "confused" by extreme values
- Predictions skewed toward expensive properties

**Solution Approach:**
```python
# Common transformations for right-skewed data
import numpy as np

# Log transformation (most common)
log_prices = np.log(prices)

# Square root transformation
sqrt_prices = np.sqrt(prices)

# Box-Cox transformation (optimal power transformation)
from scipy.stats import boxcox
transformed_prices, lambda_param = boxcox(prices)
```

### 3. A/B Testing and Conversion Rates

**Scenario**: Testing two website layouts for conversion rates

**Challenge**: Conversion rates are often right-skewed
- Most users: 0% conversion (didn't buy)
- Some users: 100% conversion (bought multiple items)
- Mean conversion inflated by power users

**Correct Approach:**
- Report median conversion for typical user experience
- Use mean for revenue impact calculations
- Segment analysis by user type

### 4. Performance Monitoring Systems

**Application**: Server response time monitoring

**Typical Pattern (Right-Skewed):**
- Mode: 50ms (most requests fast)
- Median: 75ms (half below/above)
- Mean: 150ms (pulled up by slow queries)

**Alerting Strategy:**
- Use median for general health monitoring
- Use 95th percentile for outlier detection
- Mean can mask performance issues

## Common Misconceptions and Pitfalls

### Misconception 1: "Mean is Always the Best Average"

**Reality**: Mean is heavily influenced by outliers and can be misleading in skewed data.

**Example**: If you're reporting typical salary for a company where the CEO earns $10M and everyone else earns $50K, the mean salary might be $200K - completely unrepresentative of employee experience.

### Misconception 2: "Median Always Represents the Majority"

**Reality**: Median finds the middle value, not necessarily the most common experience.

**Example**: In a dataset of test scores where most students score 90-95%, but a few fail with scores of 10-20%, the median might be 85% even though most students scored higher.

### Misconception 3: "Mode is Only for Categorical Data"

**Reality**: Mode can be meaningful for continuous data, especially when there are clear peaks or clusters.

**Example**: In salary data, there might be clear modes around entry-level, mid-level, and senior-level pay bands.

### Misconception 4: "Skewness Always Means Bad Data Quality"

**Reality**: Many natural phenomena are inherently skewed. The key is recognizing and appropriately handling skewness.

**Examples of Natural Skewness:**
- Income distributions (right-skewed in most societies)
- City sizes (few large cities, many small towns)
- Website traffic (most pages get little traffic, few go viral)

### Pitfall 1: Using Wrong Measure for Business Decisions

**Scenario**: A startup reports "average user spends 45 minutes daily" when the median is 5 minutes.

**Problem**: The average is inflated by a few power users, misleading investors about typical user engagement.

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Distribution Shape in ML Models

**Problem**: Training linear regression on skewed target variables without transformation.

**Consequence**: Model predictions will be biased toward the tail, poor performance on typical cases.
