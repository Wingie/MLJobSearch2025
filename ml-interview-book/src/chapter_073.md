# Building a Churn Prediction Model for Robinhood Users

## The Interview Question
> **Robinhood**: "Walk me through how you'd build a model to predict whether a particular Robinhood user will churn."

## Why This Question Matters

This question is a classic end-to-end machine learning system design problem that companies like Robinhood frequently ask during data science interviews. It tests multiple critical skills:

- **Business Understanding**: Can you translate a real business problem into a technical solution?
- **Product Intuition**: Do you understand how fintech apps like Robinhood work and make money?
- **Technical Depth**: Can you design, implement, and evaluate a complete ML pipeline?
- **System Thinking**: Can you consider the full lifecycle from data collection to model deployment?

Companies ask this because churn prediction is genuinely crucial for business success. Even a small monthly churn rate of 2% compounds to nearly 27% yearly churn. Since acquiring new customers costs 5-10 times more than retaining existing ones, churn prediction directly impacts profitability and growth.

## Fundamental Concepts

### What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn occurs when users stop using a product or service. In the context of Robinhood, churn could mean:
- Users who stop trading for extended periods
- Users who withdraw all their money and close accounts
- Users who reduce their trading activity significantly
- Users who cancel premium services like Robinhood Gold

Think of churn like a leaky bucket - while you're adding new customers (water) to the top, existing customers (water) are leaving through holes in the bottom. The goal is to predict which customers are likely to "leak out" so you can take action to retain them.

### Machine Learning Classification

Churn prediction is a **binary classification** problem - we're predicting one of two outcomes:
- **Churned** (1): The user will stop using the service
- **Not Churned** (0): The user will continue using the service

This is different from regression (predicting continuous numbers) or multi-class classification (predicting multiple categories).

### Key Terminology

- **Features**: Input variables we use to make predictions (e.g., trading frequency, account balance)
- **Target Variable**: What we're trying to predict (churned or not churned)
- **Training Data**: Historical data we use to teach the model
- **Model**: The algorithm that learns patterns from data to make predictions
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Ways to measure how well our model performs

## Detailed Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Problem

Before building any model, we must clearly define what "churn" means for Robinhood. This requires understanding how Robinhood makes money:

**Robinhood's Revenue Streams:**
1. **Payment for Order Flow (70%+ of revenue)**: Robinhood routes trades to market makers who pay for this order flow
2. **Robinhood Gold subscriptions**: Premium features for monthly fees
3. **Interest on cash balances**: Earning interest on users' uninvested cash
4. **Cash card interchange fees**: Fees from debit card transactions

**Possible Churn Definitions:**
- **Trading Activity**: No trades for 30+ consecutive days
- **Account Value**: Account equity below $10 for 28+ consecutive days
- **Engagement**: No app opens for 14+ consecutive days
- **Premium Cancellation**: Canceling Robinhood Gold subscription

For our example, let's define churn as: "A user whose account equity falls below $10 for 28+ consecutive days after previously having at least $10."

### Step 2: Data Collection and Feature Engineering

**Demographic Features:**
- Age, location, income level
- Account creation date
- Referral source (how they found Robinhood)

**Behavioral Features:**
- Trading frequency (daily, weekly, monthly averages)
- Types of securities traded (stocks, options, crypto)
- Trading volume and amounts
- App usage patterns (session length, time of day)
- Feature usage (research tools, notifications)

**Financial Features:**
- Account balance trends
- Portfolio diversity (number of different stocks)
- Cash vs. invested ratio
- Profit/loss performance
- Deposit and withdrawal patterns

**Engagement Features:**
- Days since last login
- Number of watchlist items
- Social features usage (if any)
- Customer support interactions

**Time-Based Features:**
- Seasonality patterns (day of week, month)
- Time since account opening
- Recent activity trends (increasing/decreasing)

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing

**Handle Missing Values:**
```python
# Example approaches
# Remove rows with missing target variable
# Fill missing numerical features with median
# Fill missing categorical features with mode
# Create "missing" indicator features
```

**Feature Scaling:**
Since features have different scales (account balance in thousands, trading frequency as counts), we need to normalize them so no single feature dominates.

**Handle Class Imbalance:**
Most users don't churn, creating imbalanced data. If 95% of users don't churn, a model that always predicts "no churn" would be 95% accurate but completely useless.

Solutions:
- **Oversampling**: Create synthetic examples of churned users
- **Undersampling**: Reduce non-churned examples
- **Class weights**: Penalize misclassifying the minority class more heavily

### Step 4: Model Selection

**Logistic Regression:**
- **Pros**: Simple, interpretable, gives probabilities
- **Cons**: May miss complex patterns
- **Best for**: When you need to explain why users churn

**Random Forest:**
- **Pros**: Handles non-linear patterns, less overfitting, feature importance
- **Cons**: Less interpretable than logistic regression
- **Best for**: Good balance of performance and interpretability

**Gradient Boosting (XGBoost):**
- **Pros**: Often highest performance, handles complex patterns
- **Cons**: Can overfit, requires more tuning
- **Best for**: When maximizing prediction accuracy

**Decision Trees:**
- **Pros**: Highly interpretable, good for business rules
- **Cons**: Prone to overfitting
- **Best for**: Creating simple, explainable business rules

### Step 5: Model Training and Validation

**Train-Test Split:**
```python
# Split data chronologically
# Train on older data, test on newer data
# This simulates real-world deployment
training_data = data[data['date'] < '2024-01-01']
test_data = data[data['date'] >= '2024-01-01']
```

**Cross-Validation:**
Use time-series cross-validation to ensure our model works across different time periods.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Logistic Regression Intuition

Logistic regression uses the sigmoid function to convert any real number into a probability between 0 and 1:

```
P(churn) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
where z = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ
```

In simple terms:
- Each feature (x₁, x₂, etc.) gets a weight (b₁, b₂, etc.)
- We multiply features by their weights and add them up
- The sigmoid function converts this sum into a probability

**Example:**
If trading frequency has weight -0.5 and account balance has weight 0.3:
- High trading frequency → lower churn probability
- High account balance → higher churn probability (counterintuitive but possible)

### Evaluation Metrics Explained

**Confusion Matrix:**
```
                Predicted
              Churn  No Churn
Actual Churn    TP      FN
    No Churn    FP      TN
```

- **TP (True Positive)**: Correctly predicted churn
- **TN (True Negative)**: Correctly predicted no churn  
- **FP (False Positive)**: Incorrectly predicted churn
- **FN (False Negative)**: Missed actual churn

**Key Metrics:**
- **Precision**: Of predicted churners, how many actually churned? TP/(TP+FP)
- **Recall**: Of actual churners, how many did we catch? TP/(TP+FN)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Practical Applications

### Real-World Implementation

**Data Pipeline:**
```python
# Daily batch job
1. Extract user behavior data from last 24 hours
2. Update feature calculations
3. Score users with trained model
4. Flag high-risk users for intervention
```

**Intervention Strategies:**
- **High churn probability**: Personal outreach, special offers
- **Medium churn probability**: Targeted email campaigns
- **Low churn probability**: Standard engagement content

**A/B Testing:**
Test intervention effectiveness by randomly assigning high-risk users to treatment (intervention) and control (no intervention) groups.

### Code Example (Simplified)

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load and prepare data
data = pd.read_csv('robinhood_user_data.csv')
features = ['trading_frequency', 'account_balance', 'days_since_login']
X = data[features]
y = data['churned']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Evaluate
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

### Performance Considerations

**Model Refresh:**
- Retrain monthly to capture changing user behavior
- Monitor for concept drift (when patterns change over time)
- Update features as new data sources become available

**Scalability:**
- Use distributed computing for large datasets
- Consider online learning for real-time updates
- Optimize feature computation for speed

## Common Misconceptions and Pitfalls

### Data Leakage
**Wrong**: Using features that wouldn't be available at prediction time
- Using "last login date" when predicting if someone will churn tomorrow
- Including future information in historical features

**Right**: Only use information available before the prediction period

### Survivorship Bias
**Wrong**: Only analyzing users who have been active for a long time
**Right**: Include all users, even those who churned early

### Feature Engineering Mistakes
**Wrong**: Creating features that are just different versions of the target
- "Days until churn" as a feature when predicting churn
**Right**: Use leading indicators that predict churn

### Evaluation Errors
**Wrong**: Using accuracy as the only metric for imbalanced data
**Right**: Focus on precision, recall, and F1-score for minority class

### Business Logic Mistakes
**Wrong**: Treating all churn equally
**Right**: Consider the value of different user segments
- A user with $100K invested churning is more important than a $10 user

## Related Concepts

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
Understanding CLV helps prioritize which users to focus retention efforts on. High CLV users who are likely to churn deserve more attention.

### Cohort Analysis
Analyzing user behavior by cohorts (groups who signed up in the same period) helps understand how churn patterns change over time.

### A/B Testing
Essential for validating that churn prediction models actually improve business outcomes when deployed.

### Real-time vs. Batch Prediction
- **Batch**: Daily scoring of all users for proactive outreach
- **Real-time**: Immediate scoring when users exhibit concerning behavior

### Multi-class Churn Prediction
Instead of binary churn/no-churn, predict different types of churn:
- Temporary dormancy
- Permanent churn
- Product-specific churn (e.g., only stopping options trading)
