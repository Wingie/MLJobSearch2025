# Probability Sampling for Feature Release Decisions

## The Interview Question
> **Lyft**: Say that you are pushing a new feature X out. You have 1000 users and each user is either a fan or not a fan of X, at random. There are 50 users out of 1000 that do not like X. You will decide whether to ship the feature or not based on sampling 5 distinct users independently and if they all like the feature, you will ship it. What's the probability you ship the feature? How does the approach change if instead of 50 users, we have N users who do not like the feature, how would we get the maximum value of unhappy people to still ship the feature?

## Why This Question Matters

This question is a masterclass in **product analytics decision-making** that tests multiple critical skills simultaneously. Top tech companies like Lyft ask this because it mirrors real-world scenarios where product managers must make shipping decisions based on limited user feedback data.

**What This Question Tests:**
- **Probability fundamentals**: Understanding sampling distributions and probability calculations
- **Business judgment**: Balancing risk tolerance with feature launch decisions  
- **Statistical reasoning**: Choosing appropriate probability models for different scenarios
- **Optimization thinking**: Finding optimal thresholds for decision-making
- **Product sense**: Understanding the trade-offs between user satisfaction and feature velocity

**Why It's Important in ML Systems:**
- A/B testing and experimentation design require similar probability reasoning
- Feature flag rollouts use comparable sampling strategies
- Model deployment decisions often involve threshold optimization
- Quality assurance testing follows similar statistical frameworks

## Fundamental Concepts

### User Satisfaction Distribution
In this scenario, we have a **finite population** of 1000 users where:
- 950 users like the feature (95% satisfaction rate)
- 50 users dislike the feature (5% dissatisfaction rate)
- Each user's preference is fixed (not random per test)

### Sampling Strategy
The decision rule is simple but powerful:
- Sample 5 distinct users independently
- Ship the feature only if **all 5** users like it
- This creates a high confidence threshold for shipping

### Key Statistical Concepts
- **Sampling without replacement**: Once we sample a user, we don't sample them again
- **Independent events**: Each user's opinion doesn't influence others
- **Hypergeometric vs. Binomial**: Different probability models apply depending on population size assumptions

## Detailed Explanation

### Part 1: Calculating the Shipping Probability

The core question asks: "What's the probability that all 5 sampled users like the feature?"

This seems like a straightforward probability calculation, but the choice of probability model matters significantly.

#### Model Choice: Hypergeometric vs. Binomial

**Hypergeometric Distribution (Exact)**:
When sampling without replacement from a finite population, we use the hypergeometric distribution:

- Population size (N) = 1000
- Success states (K) = 950 (users who like the feature)  
- Sample size (n) = 5
- Desired successes (k) = 5

The probability formula is:
```
P(X = k) = C(K,k) × C(N-K,n-k) / C(N,n)
```

Where C(a,b) represents "a choose b" combinations.

**Calculation**:
```
P(All 5 like it) = C(950,5) × C(50,0) / C(1000,5)
                 = C(950,5) × 1 / C(1000,5)
```

Computing this:
- C(950,5) = 950!/(5! × 945!) ≈ 7.73 × 10^13
- C(1000,5) = 1000!/(5! × 995!) ≈ 8.25 × 10^13
- **P(Ship) ≈ 0.937 or 93.7%**

**Binomial Approximation (Practical)**:
When the sample size is small relative to population size (5/1000 = 0.5% << 5%), we can approximate using the binomial distribution:

```
P(All 5 like it) = (0.95)^5 ≈ 0.774 or 77.4%
```

#### Why the Difference?

The hypergeometric calculation (93.7%) is higher than the binomial approximation (77.4%) because sampling without replacement from a finite population creates **favorable dependencies**. When we sample a user who likes the feature, we're slightly more likely to sample another user who likes it on subsequent draws (since we've reduced the population of potential "dislikes").

#### Which Model to Use in Practice?

For this specific problem:
- **Hypergeometric is mathematically correct** for the exact scenario described
- **Binomial is often acceptable** for practical applications when sample size is small relative to population
- **In interviews, demonstrate knowledge of both** and explain when each applies

### Part 2: Optimizing the Dissatisfaction Threshold

The second part asks: "What's the maximum value of N unhappy users where we'd still ship?"

This is an **optimization problem** where we need to find the threshold that balances risk tolerance with shipping velocity.

#### Setting Up the Optimization

Let's define our decision rule more formally:
- Ship if P(All 5 sampled users like feature) ≥ **threshold**
- Common thresholds in industry: 80%, 90%, 95%

Using the binomial approximation for simplicity:
```
P(Ship) = (1 - N/1000)^5 ≥ threshold
```

Solving for N:
```
(1 - N/1000)^5 ≥ threshold
1 - N/1000 ≥ threshold^(1/5)
N ≤ 1000 × (1 - threshold^(1/5))
```

#### Example Calculations

**For 95% confidence threshold:**
```
N ≤ 1000 × (1 - 0.95^(1/5))
N ≤ 1000 × (1 - 0.990)
N ≤ 10 unhappy users maximum
```

**For 90% confidence threshold:**
```
N ≤ 1000 × (1 - 0.90^(1/5))
N ≤ 1000 × (1 - 0.979)
N ≤ 21 unhappy users maximum
```

**For 80% confidence threshold:**
```
N ≤ 1000 × (1 - 0.80^(1/5))
N ≤ 1000 × (1 - 0.956)
N ≤ 44 unhappy users maximum
```

#### Business Interpretation

These thresholds represent different risk tolerance levels:

- **Conservative (95% threshold)**: Ship only if ≤1% of users are unhappy
- **Moderate (90% threshold)**: Ship if ≤2.1% of users are unhappy  
- **Aggressive (80% threshold)**: Ship if ≤4.4% of users are unhappy

## Mathematical Foundations

### Hypergeometric Distribution Deep Dive

The hypergeometric distribution models sampling without replacement and has the form:

```
P(X = k) = C(K,k) × C(N-K,n-k) / C(N,n)
```

**Parameters:**
- N: Total population size
- K: Number of success states in population
- n: Sample size
- k: Number of successes in sample

**Properties:**
- Mean: μ = n × (K/N)
- Variance: σ² = n × (K/N) × (1-K/N) × (N-n)/(N-1)
- Approaches binomial as N → ∞

### Binomial Distribution as Approximation

When sampling with replacement or when N is large relative to n:

```
P(X = k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)
```

**When to use binomial approximation:**
- Sample size < 5% of population size
- Population size > 20 × sample size
- Computational simplicity is preferred

### Risk-Threshold Optimization

The general framework for threshold optimization:

1. **Define success criteria**: What probability of shipping gives acceptable risk?
2. **Model the relationship**: How does unhappy user count affect shipping probability?
3. **Solve the constraint**: Find maximum N given probability threshold
4. **Validate assumptions**: Check if model assumptions hold in practice

## Practical Applications

### Real-World Feature Release Scenarios

**Example 1: Mobile App Feature**
A social media company wants to release a new story feature:
- 100,000 beta users
- Test with 50 users
- Ship if 45+ users are satisfied
- Calculate maximum tolerable dissatisfaction rate

**Example 2: E-commerce Checkout Flow**
An online retailer tests a new checkout process:
- 10,000 daily users
- A/B test with 200 users per variant
- Ship if new flow outperforms baseline with 90% confidence

**Example 3: Enterprise Software Module**
A SaaS company launches a new analytics dashboard:
- 500 enterprise clients
- Beta test with 20 clients
- Ship if all 20 report satisfaction

### Code Implementation Example

```python
import math
from scipy.special import comb

def hypergeometric_probability(N, K, n, k):
    """Calculate hypergeometric probability"""
    return comb(K, k) * comb(N-K, n-k) / comb(N, n)

def binomial_probability(n, k, p):
    """Calculate binomial probability"""
    return comb(n, k) * (p**k) * ((1-p)**(n-k))

def max_unhappy_users(total_users, sample_size, threshold):
    """Find maximum unhappy users given threshold"""
    threshold_root = threshold**(1/sample_size)
    max_unhappy = total_users * (1 - threshold_root)
    return int(max_unhappy)

# Example usage
N = 1000  # Total users
n = 5     # Sample size
K = 950   # Happy users

# Exact calculation
prob_exact = hypergeometric_probability(N, K, n, 5)
print(f"Exact probability (hypergeometric): {prob_exact:.4f}")

# Approximation
p = K/N
prob_approx = binomial_probability(n, 5, p)
print(f"Approximate probability (binomial): {prob_approx:.4f}")

# Maximum unhappy users for different thresholds
thresholds = [0.80, 0.90, 0.95]
for threshold in thresholds:
    max_unhappy = max_unhappy_users(N, n, threshold)
    print(f"Threshold {threshold}: Max {max_unhappy} unhappy users")
```

### Performance Considerations

**Computational Complexity:**
- Hypergeometric calculations: O(n) for combination computations
- Binomial calculations: O(1) for simple probability formulas
- Optimization: O(1) for closed-form threshold solutions

**Scalability:**
- Small samples (n < 100): Use exact hypergeometric
- Large samples: Binomial approximation sufficient
- Very large populations: Normal approximation may apply

## Common Misconceptions and Pitfalls

### Misconception 1: "Always Use Binomial Distribution"

**Wrong Thinking**: "Since we're calculating probabilities, we should use binomial distribution."

**Why It's Wrong**: Binomial assumes sampling with replacement or infinite population. For finite populations with substantial sample sizes, hypergeometric gives more accurate results.

**Correct Approach**: Choose the distribution based on sampling method and population size relative to sample size.

### Misconception 2: "Higher Sample Size Always Gives Better Decisions"

**Wrong Thinking**: "We should sample 50 users instead of 5 for more accuracy."

**Why It's Wrong**: Larger samples reduce variance but also increase the required satisfaction rate to achieve the same confidence level. There's a trade-off between statistical power and practical implementation.

**Correct Approach**: Choose sample size based on business constraints, required confidence level, and acceptable risk tolerance.

### Misconception 3: "Independence Assumption Always Holds"

**Wrong Thinking**: "User preferences are independent, so we can ignore population effects."

**Why It's Wrong**: In real scenarios, user preferences might be correlated due to shared characteristics, network effects, or cohort behaviors.

**Correct Approach**: Validate independence assumptions and consider stratified sampling if populations have known sub-groups.

### Misconception 4: "Threshold Optimization Has a Single Answer"

**Wrong Thinking**: "There's one optimal threshold for all situations."

**Why It's Wrong**: Optimal thresholds depend on business context, risk tolerance, competitive pressure, and development costs.

**Correct Approach**: Frame threshold selection as a business decision with statistical inputs, not a purely mathematical optimization.

### Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Model Selection Logic**: Demonstrate understanding of when to use different probability distributions
2. **Business Context**: Connect statistical results to real product decisions
3. **Optimization Framework**: Show systematic approach to threshold setting
4. **Practical Considerations**: Acknowledge assumptions and limitations

### Follow-up Questions to Expect

**Q: "How would this change with a larger population?"**
A: "With larger populations, the hypergeometric and binomial results converge. We could also consider normal approximations for very large samples."

**Q: "What if user preferences weren't independent?"**
A: "We'd need to account for correlation structure, possibly using stratified sampling or adjusting our confidence calculations."

**Q: "How would you validate this approach in practice?"**
A: "We could run historical backtests, compare predicted vs. actual user satisfaction, and use A/B testing to validate the threshold choice itself."

### Red Flags to Avoid

- **Don't ignore the finite population**: Jumping straight to binomial without considering hypergeometric
- **Don't forget business context**: Focusing only on math without connecting to product decisions  
- **Don't oversimplify**: Claiming there's one "correct" threshold without discussing trade-offs
- **Don't miss the optimization aspect**: Only answering the first part and ignoring the threshold question
