# Data Leakage in Class Imbalance: The Hidden Trap of Premature Duplication

## The Interview Question
> **Top Tech Company**: You're asked to build an algorithm estimating the risk of premature birth for pregnant women using ultrasound images. You have 500 examples in total, of which only 175 were examples of preterm births (positive examples, label = 1). To compensate for this class imbalance, you decide to duplicate all of the positive examples, and then split the data into train, validation and test sets. Explain what is a problem with this approach.

## Why This Question Matters

This question is a favorite among top tech companies because it tests multiple critical skills simultaneously:

- **Data preprocessing knowledge**: Understanding the proper order of operations in ML pipelines
- **Data leakage detection**: Recognizing subtle but devastating methodological errors
- **Real-world application awareness**: Medical AI systems require extremely rigorous validation
- **Class imbalance understanding**: Knowing how to handle unequal class distributions correctly

Companies ask this because data leakage is one of the most common yet dangerous mistakes in production ML systems. A model that performs brilliantly in development but fails catastrophically in production can cost millions and, in medical contexts, potentially harm patients.

## Fundamental Concepts

### What is Data Leakage?

Data leakage occurs when information that wouldn't be available at prediction time somehow gets used during model training. Think of it like cheating on an exam - if you see the answers before taking the test, your score won't reflect your true knowledge.

### Class Imbalance

When one class (like "preterm birth") appears much less frequently than another (like "normal birth"), we have class imbalance. In our example:
- 175 positive examples (preterm births) = 35%
- 325 negative examples (normal births) = 65%

This imbalance can cause models to be biased toward predicting the majority class.

### Train-Test-Validation Split

We divide our data into three parts:
- **Training set**: Used to teach the model patterns
- **Validation set**: Used to tune model parameters and make decisions
- **Test set**: Used only once to evaluate final performance (simulates real-world data)

## Detailed Explanation

### The Problematic Approach

Let's walk through what happens with the flawed approach:

1. **Start with 500 examples**: 175 positive, 325 negative
2. **Duplicate all positive examples**: Now we have 175 × 2 = 350 positive examples
3. **Total dataset**: 350 positive + 325 negative = 675 examples
4. **Split into train/val/test**: Each split contains both original and duplicated samples

### The Hidden Problem: Data Contamination

Here's the critical issue: **identical samples end up in different splits**. 

Imagine Patient A's ultrasound shows signs of preterm birth. After duplication:
- Original Patient A scan → might go to training set
- Duplicated Patient A scan → might go to validation or test set

When the model encounters the "new" Patient A scan in validation/testing, it's not truly unseen data - it's identical to something from training!

### A Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're studying for a math test. Your study material (training data) includes the problem: "What is 2 + 2?" Later, the actual test (validation/test data) includes the exact same problem: "What is 2 + 2?" 

You'd get it right, but this doesn't prove you understand addition - you just memorized that specific problem. This is exactly what happens with duplicated data across splits.

### Why This Creates False Confidence

The model appears to perform amazingly well because:
- **Inflated accuracy**: The model "recognizes" duplicated samples it has already seen
- **Overoptimistic metrics**: AUC, precision, and recall all appear artificially high
- **False sense of generalization**: We think the model learned real patterns when it just memorized specific examples

### The Correct Approach

The proper sequence is:

1. **Split first**: Divide original 500 examples into train/val/test
2. **Then handle imbalance**: Apply duplication/oversampling only to training set
3. **Keep validation/test pure**: Use only original, unseen samples for evaluation

Example with 60/20/20 split:
- **Training**: 300 original samples → duplicate positives → ~405 training samples
- **Validation**: 100 original samples (no duplication)
- **Test**: 100 original samples (no duplication)

## Mathematical Foundations

### Measuring the Impact

Research shows that applying oversampling before splitting can inflate performance metrics by:
- **AUC**: Up to +0.34 points
- **Sensitivity**: Up to +0.33 points
- **Specificity**: Up to +0.31 points
- **Balanced Accuracy**: Up to +0.37 points

### Statistical Independence

For valid evaluation, our test set must be statistically independent from our training set. If X_train and X_test share identical samples:

P(X_test | X_train) ≠ P(X_test)

This violates the fundamental assumption that test data represents unseen, real-world scenarios.

### Information Theory Perspective

From an information theory standpoint, duplicated samples provide zero new information. If we have sample S in our training set and its duplicate S' in our test set:

H(S') = 0 (zero entropy/information content)

The model's prediction on S' doesn't demonstrate generalization ability.

## Practical Applications

### Medical Imaging Context

In medical AI, this problem is particularly dangerous because:

**False Medical Confidence**: A model might appear 95% accurate in validation but only 70% accurate on truly new patients. This could lead to:
- Misdiagnosis of high-risk pregnancies
- Unnecessary medical interventions
- Delayed treatment for at-risk patients

**Regulatory Issues**: FDA and other medical device regulators specifically look for proper data splitting protocols. Contaminated validation can prevent medical AI approval.

### Industry Examples

**Radiology AI**: A chest X-ray model for pneumonia detection showed 95% accuracy during development but only 78% in clinical deployment due to duplicate patient scans across splits.

**Drug Discovery**: A molecular property prediction model achieved 92% R² during validation but failed to generalize to new chemical compounds due to molecular duplicates in training and test sets.

### Code Example (Conceptual)

```python
# WRONG APPROACH
def wrong_approach(data, labels):
    # Duplicate positive samples first
    positive_mask = labels == 1
    duplicated_data = np.concatenate([data, data[positive_mask]])
    duplicated_labels = np.concatenate([labels, labels[positive_mask]])
    
    # Then split - CONTAMINATION OCCURS HERE
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        duplicated_data, duplicated_labels, test_size=0.2
    )
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

# CORRECT APPROACH
def correct_approach(data, labels):
    # Split FIRST
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        data, labels, test_size=0.2, stratify=labels
    )
    
    # Handle imbalance ONLY in training set
    positive_mask = y_train == 1
    X_train_balanced = np.concatenate([X_train, X_train[positive_mask]])
    y_train_balanced = np.concatenate([y_train, y_train[positive_mask]])
    
    # Test set remains pure
    return X_train_balanced, X_test, y_train_balanced, y_test
```

## Common Misconceptions and Pitfalls

### Misconception 1: "Stratified Splitting Solves Everything"

**Wrong thinking**: "If I use stratified splitting, duplicates will be distributed proportionally, so it's fine."

**Reality**: Stratified splitting maintains class proportions but doesn't prevent identical samples from appearing in different splits. You still get data leakage.

### Misconception 2: "Small Datasets Need Different Rules"

**Wrong thinking**: "We only have 500 samples, so we need to be creative with our splitting approach."

**Reality**: Small datasets make proper methodology MORE important, not less. The temptation to "bend the rules" is highest when data is scarce, but this leads to unreliable models.

### Misconception 3: "Advanced Oversampling Methods Are Safe"

**Wrong thinking**: "Simple duplication is bad, but SMOTE or ADASYN applied before splitting is okay."

**Reality**: ANY oversampling method applied before splitting can cause leakage. SMOTE creates synthetic samples using k-nearest neighbors, which can use information from test samples to create training samples.

### Misconception 4: "The Problem Only Affects Simple Duplication"

**Wrong thinking**: "This only matters for exact duplicates. Near-duplicates or augmented samples are fine."

**Reality**: Even similar samples can cause leakage. In medical imaging, slight rotations or brightness adjustments of the same patient's scan still represent the same underlying case.

## Interview Strategy

### How to Structure Your Answer

1. **Identify the core problem immediately**: "The main issue is data leakage caused by having identical samples in both training and test sets."

2. **Explain the mechanism**: "When we duplicate before splitting, the same patient's data can appear in training and testing, violating the independence assumption."

3. **Describe the consequences**: "This leads to overly optimistic performance metrics that don't reflect real-world performance."

4. **Provide the correct solution**: "We should split the original data first, then apply oversampling only to the training set."

5. **Demonstrate domain knowledge**: "In medical AI, this is particularly critical because false confidence can impact patient safety."

### Key Points to Emphasize

- **Order matters**: Preprocessing should generally happen after splitting
- **Test set sanctity**: The test set must truly represent unseen data
- **Real-world implications**: Especially important in high-stakes domains like healthcare
- **Alternative solutions**: Mention other class imbalance techniques (cost-sensitive learning, ensemble methods)

### Follow-up Questions to Expect

**"What other oversampling techniques would have the same problem?"**
Answer: SMOTE, ADASYN, BorderlineSMOTE - any technique applied to the full dataset before splitting.

**"How would you detect this problem in an existing codebase?"**
Answer: Look for preprocessing steps before train_test_split, unusually high validation performance, perfect or near-perfect accuracy on certain samples.

**"What if we're doing cross-validation instead of a single train-test split?"**
Answer: The same principle applies - oversampling must happen within each fold, not across the entire dataset.

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Don't suggest "it's probably fine" for small datasets
- Don't recommend complex workarounds instead of proper splitting
- Don't dismiss the problem as "just theoretical"
- Don't confuse this with other types of data leakage
