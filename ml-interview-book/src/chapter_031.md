# The Gambler's Ruin Problem: Asymmetric Coin Flip Probability

## The Interview Question
> **Hedge Fund / Quantitative Trading**: I have $50 and I'm gambling on a series of coin flips. For each head I win $2 and for each tail I lose $1. What's the probability that I will run out of money?

## Why This Question Matters

This classic probability problem is a favorite among hedge funds, quantitative trading firms, and data science teams because it tests multiple critical skills simultaneously:

**Mathematical Modeling**: Can you translate a real-world scenario into a mathematical framework? This question requires recognizing it as a variant of the famous "Gambler's Ruin Problem."

**Risk Assessment**: Understanding probability of ruin is fundamental to risk management in finance. Traders and portfolio managers must constantly evaluate scenarios where losses could accumulate to dangerous levels.

**Markov Chain Analysis**: The problem involves understanding state-dependent probabilities and transitions, which are crucial for modeling financial markets and algorithmic trading strategies.

**Expected Value vs. Risk**: Despite having a positive expected value per flip (+$0.50), there's still a meaningful probability of ruin due to the asymmetric payoffs and finite starting capital.

Companies use this question to identify candidates who can think probabilistically under uncertainty—a core skill for quantitative roles in finance and data science.

## Fundamental Concepts

### The Gambler's Ruin Problem
The Gambler's Ruin Problem is a classic scenario in probability theory where a gambler with finite wealth plays against an opponent (often with infinite wealth) in a series of independent bets. The game continues until either the gambler reaches a target amount or loses all their money (goes "bust" or faces "ruin").

### Key Terms
- **Ruin Probability**: The likelihood that a gambler will lose all their money before reaching their goal
- **Random Walk**: A mathematical model describing a path of successive random steps
- **Absorbing Barrier**: A boundary condition that stops the process (in this case, reaching $0)
- **Asymmetric Payoffs**: When winning and losing amounts are different ($2 vs. $1 in our case)
- **Expected Value**: The average outcome of a random event over many trials

### Prerequisites
- Basic probability (coin flips, independence)
- Understanding of expected value calculations
- Familiarity with sequences and series (helpful but not required)

## Detailed Explanation

### Setting Up the Problem

Let's break down our specific scenario:
- Starting capital: $50
- Win condition: Heads → Gain $2
- Loss condition: Tails → Lose $1
- Fair coin: P(Heads) = P(Tails) = 0.5
- Game ends when money reaches $0 (ruin)

### Why This Isn't Intuitive

At first glance, this might seem like a "good bet":
- Expected value per flip = 0.5 × ($2) + 0.5 × (-$1) = $0.50
- With positive expected value, shouldn't we eventually get rich?

The counterintuitive truth is that **despite favorable odds, there's still a meaningful probability of ruin** due to the random nature of coin flips and our finite starting capital.

### Modeling as a Random Walk

We can model this as a random walk where:
- Current position = current money amount
- Each step moves us either:
  - +$2 with probability 0.5 (heads)
  - -$1 with probability 0.5 (tails)
- Absorbing barrier at $0 (game over)

### The Mathematics Behind Asymmetric Payoffs

Unlike the classical symmetric gambler's ruin (where wins and losses are equal), our problem has asymmetric payoffs. This makes the mathematics more complex.

For a random walk with:
- Step up: +a with probability p
- Step down: -b with probability q = 1-p
- Starting position: i

The traditional approach uses difference equations, but the asymmetric nature requires more sophisticated analysis.

### Simplification Through Rescaling

One approach is to rescale the problem. Since we win $2 for heads and lose $1 for tails, we can think of each "unit" as $1, so:
- Heads: Move up 2 units
- Tails: Move down 1 unit
- Starting position: 50 units

This transforms our problem into finding the probability of a random walk reaching 0 before reaching infinity, starting from position 50.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Expected Value Analysis

The expected value per flip is:
```
E[single flip] = 0.5 × (+$2) + 0.5 × (-$1) = +$0.50
```

If we could play forever without risk of ruin, our expected wealth would grow by $0.50 per flip.

### The Ruin Probability Formula

For an asymmetric random walk against an infinite opponent, where:
- Probability of moving up by amount `a` = p
- Probability of moving down by amount `b` = q = 1-p
- Starting capital = i units

If the game is favorable (expected value > 0), the ruin probability is:
```
P(ruin) = (q/p)^(i/gcd(a,b)) if p × a > q × b
```

For our specific case:
- a = 2, b = 1, p = q = 0.5
- i = 50 (starting position)
- This gives us the ratio q/p = 1

### The Critical Insight

When p = q = 0.5 (fair coin), even with asymmetric payoffs that favor us, the classical result tells us something surprising: **if we play forever against an infinite opponent, ruin is certain with probability 1**.

However, our problem is slightly different because we're not necessarily playing forever—we might choose to stop at some point, or there might be practical constraints.

### Finite vs. Infinite Games

The mathematical treatment depends on whether we're playing:
1. **Against an infinite opponent forever**: Ruin is certain despite positive expected value
2. **For a fixed number of flips**: Ruin probability is less than 1
3. **Until we reach a specific target**: Changes the boundary conditions

## Practical Applications

### Risk Management in Trading

Hedge funds and trading firms face similar scenarios constantly:
- **Position Sizing**: How much capital to risk on each trade when payoffs are asymmetric
- **Kelly Criterion**: Optimal bet sizing to maximize long-term growth while minimizing ruin risk
- **Drawdown Analysis**: Understanding how bad losing streaks can get before recovery

### Real-World Example: Options Trading

Consider selling put options:
- Most of the time (say 90%), you collect a small premium ($100)
- Occasionally (10%), you face a large loss ($900)
- Expected value = 0.9 × $100 + 0.1 × (-$900) = $0
- Despite neutral expected value, there's significant ruin risk

### Portfolio Management

Modern portfolio theory considers similar trade-offs:
- High-frequency strategies often have positive expected returns but carry ruin risk
- Diversification helps, but can't eliminate the fundamental mathematical constraints
- Position sizing becomes crucial for long-term survival

### Cryptocurrency and Leverage

Leveraged trading in volatile markets like cryptocurrency exhibits similar dynamics:
- Small wins accumulate gradually
- Large losses can wipe out accounts quickly
- Positive expected value doesn't guarantee survival

## Common Misconceptions and Pitfalls

### Misconception 1: "Positive Expected Value Means I Can't Lose"
**Reality**: Expected value is a long-term average. In the short to medium term, negative outcomes can accumulate and cause ruin even in favorable games.

### Misconception 2: "I Can Just Keep Doubling My Bet"
**Reality**: Martingale strategies (doubling bets after losses) seem appealing but require infinite capital to guarantee success. With finite capital, they often lead to faster ruin.

### Misconception 3: "The Law of Large Numbers Will Save Me"
**Reality**: The law of large numbers requires surviving long enough to see it work. If you go broke first, the mathematics become irrelevant.

### Misconception 4: "Past Results Affect Future Probabilities"
**Reality**: Each coin flip is independent. Previous streaks don't change future probabilities (the "gambler's fallacy").

### Common Calculation Errors

1. **Ignoring the finite starting capital constraint**
2. **Confusing expected value with guaranteed outcomes**
3. **Not accounting for the absorbing barrier at $0**
4. **Assuming the game continues indefinitely**

## Interview Strategy

### How to Structure Your Answer

1. **Clarify the Setup**: "Let me make sure I understand: starting with $50, heads wins $2, tails loses $1, fair coin, and we stop if we reach $0?"

2. **Identify the Framework**: "This is a variant of the Gambler's Ruin Problem with asymmetric payoffs."

3. **Calculate Expected Value**: "First, let me check the expected value per flip: 0.5 × $2 + 0.5 × (-$1) = +$0.50."

4. **Address the Paradox**: "Interestingly, despite positive expected value, there's still a meaningful probability of ruin due to the random nature and finite starting capital."

5. **Discuss the Mathematics**: Explain your approach (simulation, analytical solution, or approximation).

6. **Provide Intuition**: "The asymmetric payoffs help us, but variance can still cause extended losing streaks that exhaust our capital."

### Key Points to Emphasize

- Recognition of the gambler's ruin framework
- Understanding that positive expected value ≠ guaranteed profit
- Ability to handle asymmetric payoffs mathematically
- Appreciation for the role of variance and finite capital

### Follow-up Questions to Expect

1. **"What if we started with $100 instead?"**
   - Higher starting capital reduces ruin probability
   - Relationship is typically exponential

2. **"What if the coin was biased 60% heads?"**
   - Changes the expected value and ruin probability
   - Need to recalculate with new probabilities

3. **"How would you estimate this computationally?"**
   - Monte Carlo simulation approach
   - Run thousands of trials and count ruin frequency

4. **"What's the optimal strategy here?"**
   - Kelly criterion for optimal bet sizing
   - Risk management considerations

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Don't immediately jump to "since expected value is positive, ruin probability is zero"
- Don't ignore the finite starting capital constraint
- Don't confuse this with other probability problems
- Don't get lost in complex mathematics without explaining intuition
